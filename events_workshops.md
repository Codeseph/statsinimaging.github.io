NIMH Workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Data Visualizations
==================
<b>June 28--30, 2021 | Virtual</b>

This is a two-day virtual workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Dynamic Data Visualizations for Mental Health Studies 
organized by [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/). The major objectives of this workshop are to identify 
gaps in statistical methods and data visualization tools for mental health studies, and to promote discussions among statisticians, data scientists, computational 
scientists, quantitative neuroscientists, psychiatrists and psychologists to identify best practices for evaluating and interpreting 
meaningful effects in mental health research.

*Day One (June 28, 2021): <i>Advances in Statistical Methods and Applications</i>

The goal of the day one workshop is to address the role of statistical methods in identifying meaningful effects in large neuro-behavioral 
samples (including neuroimaging and behavioral data), administrative data, or social media sources.

*Day Two (June 30, 2021): <i>Dynamic and Interactive Data Visualizations</i>

The goal of the day two workshop is to showcase advanced methods for dynamic and interactive data visualization. There will also be 
opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge visualization tools via interactive tutorial sessions.
