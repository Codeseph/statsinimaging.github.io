==================
<b>June 27, 2023 | Montr√©al, CA</b>

Neuroimaging Statistics Workshop is organized by Dr. Thomas Nichols and Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline. The workshop features Keynote lectures 
by distinguished imaging statisticians. In particular, the workshop will be opened with the <b>Keith Worsley Lecture</b> in honor of 
Professor Keith Worsley who was one of the most prominent imaging statisticians and pioneered important ground-work in fMRI analysis. The 
keynote is delivered by Keith's student Dr. [Jonathan Taylor](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/). The workshop is passionate about 
having a diverse set of speakers and including junior researchers as well. ASA Statistics in Imaging Section is a proud sponsor of the

[NIMH Workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Data Visualizations](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/events/2021/workshop-advanced-statistical-methods-and-dynamic-data-visualizations-for-mental-health-studies/)
==================
<b>June 28--30, 2021 | Virtual</b>

This is a two-day virtual workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Dynamic Data Visualizations for Mental Health Studies 
organized by [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/). The major objectives of this workshop are to identify 
gaps in statistical methods and data visualization tools for mental health studies, and to promote discussions among statisticians, data scientists, computational 
scientists, quantitative neuroscientists, psychiatrists and psychologists to identify best practices for evaluating and interpreting 
meaningful effects in mental health research.

<ins>Day One</ins> (June 28, 2021): <i>Advances in Statistical Methods and Applications</i>

The goal of the day one workshop is to address the role of statistical methods in identifying meaningful effects in large neuro-behavioral 
samples (including neuroimaging and behavioral data), administrative data, or social media sources.

<ins>Day Two</ins> (June 30, 2021): <i>Dynamic and Interactive Data Visualizations</i>

The goal of the day two workshop is to showcase advanced methods for dynamic and interactive data visualization. There will also be 
opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge visualization tools via interactive tutorial sessions.
