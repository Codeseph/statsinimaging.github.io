Statistics in Imaging Virtual Working Group
==================

The Statistics in Imaging (Virtual) Working Group is fairly informal and aims for regular discussions on a range of topics pertaining to imaging statistics.  Talks are about 15-20 minutes and can be on current, unfinished work, completed research, or a topic you'd just like to share with the community.
