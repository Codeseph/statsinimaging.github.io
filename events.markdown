The ASA Statistical Imaging (SI) Section holds its own program of meetings. 
The Statistical Methods in Imaging (SMI) conferences are held in late May annually. 
The content of these events reflects the broad interests of the Section, including neuroimaging, immunofluorescence imaging, and geospatial imaging.
The ASA SI Section also hosts multiple workshops, webinars and other events every year.
